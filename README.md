Question :Median of Two Sorted Arrays
description:
	1.There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
	2.Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
	3.You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.
example:
	nums1 = [1, 3]
	nums2 = [2]
	The median is 2.0

//please use java to finish the question and do good testing
	class MedianOfTwoSortedArray {
   	 	public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        
    }
}
